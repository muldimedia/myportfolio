            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
              Greetings, I'm Franko (Panagiotis) Hysenllari, originally from
              Albania and having spent the majority of my life in Greece. With a
              proven track record in effectively managing multiple priorities
              and a positive outlook, I am a dependable candidate ready to take
              on additional responsibilities to contribute to team success.
              Currently seeking a full-time position, I am enthusiastic about
              embracing professional challenges that allow me to leverage my
              interpersonal skills, exceptional leadership, and adept
              problem-solving abilities. <br /><br />Furthermore, I am a
              detail-oriented and collaborative individual, driven by a passion
              for delivering outstanding service that consistently surpasses
              customer expectations. Beyond my expertise in customer service
              best practices, I am also eager to make a transition into a
              developer career at the earliest opportunity. I bring a strong
              commitment to learning and adapting, making me well-prepared to
              excel in the dynamic field of development.
            </p>
