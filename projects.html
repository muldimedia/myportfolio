          <h2>Rc Car Arduino, Serres.</h2>
          <p>
            For this project, I attempted to remotely control an RC car using
            WiFi or Bluetooth through the installation of an Arduino Uno R3.
            However, my efforts were unsuccessful due to either incompatible
            hardware or wiring issues. Despite this setback, I was able to make
            the car operational through Ethernet. Ultimately, I was able to
            program the car to move forward or backward and included ultrasonic
            sensors to detect obstacles and stop the car when an object was
            within 20 cm of the RC car. (I did make a short PowerPoint
            addressing this in Greek) <br />

          <p>
            I have actively engaged in Guided Projects on Coursera, focusing on
            enhancing my skills in web development. Having recently acquired
            foundational knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, | am currently
            undertaking the practical application of these languages by building
            a scratch website to further solidify my knowledge in a hands-on
            manner.
